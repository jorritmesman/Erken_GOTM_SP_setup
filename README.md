# Erken_GOTM_SP_setup
Setup of the GOTM-Selmaprotbas model for Lake Erken

The files in this repository replicate the main model run in the publication "Drivers of phytoplankton responses to summer wind events in a stratified lake: A modeling study", by J.P. Mesman, A.I. Ayala, S. Goyette, J. Kasparian, R. Marc√©, H. Markensten, J.A.A. Stelzer, M. Thayne, M.K. Thomas, D.C. Pierson, and B.W. Ibelings (2022), Limnology and Oceanography, 67(4), 856-873, doi:10.1002/lno.12040

- To run the model, clone this repository, open command prompt, navigate to the folder on your local machine in command prompt, and type `gotm`

- The executable provided works on Windows 10, but will not work on MacOS or Linux. In that case, you will have to compile GOTM-Selmaprotbas yourself; see code & instructions on https://github.com/jorritmesman/selmaprotbas. 

- To run the base (i.e. no wind perturbations) RCP8.5 simulation, you need to replace the references to the meteorological file inside gotm.yaml to `Erken_MetFile_1960-2020_climate_run.dat`. Note that in this file, air temperatures have only been scaled from 1991 onwards.  

- To run the other scenarios in the study, you need to follow the description in the Methodology section (or contact the corresponding author).
