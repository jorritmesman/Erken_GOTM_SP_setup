# Erken_GOTM_SP_setup
Setup of the GOTM-Selmaprotbas for Lake Erken

The files in this repository replicate the main model run in the publication "Wind speed, thermal  structure, nutrients, and light availability control phytoplankton response to storms in a stratified lake: a modelling study", by J.P. Mesman, A.I. Ayala, S. Goyette, J. Kasparian, R. Marc√©, H. Markensten, J.A.A. Stelzer, M. Thayne, M.K. Thomas, D.C. Pierson, and B.W. Ibelings (not yet published).

- To run the model, clone this repository, open command prompt, navigate to the folder on your local machine in command prompt, and type `gotm`

- To run the different scenarios in the study, you need to follow the description in the Methodology section (or contact the corresponding author). 

- The executable provided works on Windows 10, but will not work on MacOS or Linux. In that case, you will have to compile GOTM-Selmaprotbas yourself; see code & instructions on https://github.com/jorritmesman/selmaprotbas.
